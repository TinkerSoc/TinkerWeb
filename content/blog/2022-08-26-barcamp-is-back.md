BarCamp Canterbury is back in 2022!
BarCamp is a series of 'un-conferences' where there is no set schedule, people can show up and give a talk about something they find interesting. 
Talk slots are claimed anarchically at the start of the day.
It's always a lot of fun with longer form talks and lightning talks on a range of hacker/maker topics.
The theme this year is _Are you ... a wizard? ðŸ§™_

This year it will be hosted at Canterbury Christ Church University in the [Verena Holmes building](https://www.canterbury.ac.uk/study-here/student-life/our-locations/canterbury-campus/verena-holmes-building), as part of a new tradition of attempting to run it alternately at CCCU and UKC.
You can sign up to BarCamp Canterbury 2022 on [Event Bright page](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/barcamp-canterbury-2022-tickets-402348734897).
