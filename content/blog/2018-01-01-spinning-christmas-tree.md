Therefore, the main components in this build are; a 'Lazy Susan' which made with laser cut circles and marbles, a mount for the tree to slot into - which is also laser cut, and a motor that would be more at home on a remote control drone. 

The build was mainly a process of designing the circles, motor mount and tree mount in Inventor, and cutting them out using The Shed's laser cutter. Some trial and error was involved for the circles in particular to make the marbles run as smooth as possible (which ended up being rather rough). Holes were cut in the centre of the circles to run a bolt through to hold the upper and lower portions together, and then parts were glued together, using a mixture of wood glue and superglue (where appropriate).
