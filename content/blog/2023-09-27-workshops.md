Welcome back!

Remember we've moved to the Hackspace in Kennedy this term.

For the TinkerSoc workshops, a worksheet has been prepared, you can access it [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YzBj_CYyysWbxPEVzIAuCCROrfWD2kxdBpoiFGngu8o/edit).

We'll collect info like this in an easier to find part of the website in the coming weeks.
