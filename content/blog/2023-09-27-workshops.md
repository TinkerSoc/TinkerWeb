Welcome back!

Remember we've moved to the Hackspace in Kennedy this term.

For the TinkerSoc workshops, some workshops have been prepared. You can access them below.
[Lesson One](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e_mnXeEv4VZOmMrGaFHMhLB0Mk78D5Qt/view).

[Lesson Two](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16_dUNq3MUJVjAxDiRbvAcCcfCq7od6PB/view).

We'll collect info like this in an easier to find part of the website in the coming weeks.
