## Unfortunately due to the recent snowfall TinkerSoc tonight (Monday 13th) will be cancelled. ##

I imagine the snow will be gone by the OpenMic next week, I'll be in touch.

In good news: The hoodie people have received the money, and are getting the hoodies printed. More news on that when I hear something. :)

Cheers,

Matt
