My entry for Antweight Robot Wars is *Fire Ant*, based on the “Antweight Robotwars
Firestorm R/C Robot” Antweight Robotwars Firestorm R/C Robotdesign [published to
Thingverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1665299) by Team Firestorm member
Alex Mordue, which I then modified.

It is armed with a front-hinged true flipper allows it to turn over other robots
and right itself if it is upside down. It weights 116g, cost under £50 and is
primarily made from 3D printed plastic.

The modifications I made were using elastic bands superglued to the wheels as I
was unable to make the correct tires, adding a small strip of metal to the front
of the wedge to allow it to get under other robots easier, three small bits of
wire I superglued to the sides and back of the robot to prevent it from getting
stuck on its sides and adding a large piece of metal on the flipper to stop
other robots driving over and to help it self-right. I also split the top plate
into tow to make it easier to access the internals. I also added a removable
link that when removed, completely cuts the power to the robot, making it safe.

You can see some footage of *Fire Ant* in an arena test battle with *Meme
Machine* and *Loanerbot*
[here](https://www.facebook.com/TinkerSoc/posts/10154446530217557).

In the Freshers Faire Event, *Fire Ant* was the best performing robot, fighting in
all three fights, winning the first two and coming a close second in the last
fight.

Before its next big fight, I need to replace the servo controlling the flipper
as it has burnt out. I am also planning to build an invertible robot with a
rotating drum weapon.
