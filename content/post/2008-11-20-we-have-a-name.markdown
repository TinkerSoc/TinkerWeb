Hello Folks,

We have officially applied to Kent Union to start the Tinkering Society (or the TinkerSoc for daily usage) and we will soon be accepting members! You might also have noticed that we have moved on to our new shiny domain so if you come across any problems please let us know. There is lots going on and we have some really cool ideas planned so check out the wiki, where all the magic happens :)

The mailing list is also set up, details of which can be found in the wiki so do join in if you'd like to get notified of future events.

Exciting stuff :)
