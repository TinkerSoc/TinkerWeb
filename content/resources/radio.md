# History

We did have a Amateur Radio Society club which was run by the students which was
very successful through the 70s and 80s up to about 1995.

It's popularity declined after 1995 and then it was very difficult to get the 15
students to sign up, that the student union required to form the club.

In 1999 the Radio shack, that was located just east of the old Oast House, was
demolished to make way for the building of Stock Court.

# Now

TinkerSoc has been working with the Hilderstone Radio club to get a radio group
running on campus again. We're getting our members to obtain foundation amateur
radio licences, and are looking into finding radio equipment to use!

There are 3 licenses available in the UK, each builds on the last.

### Foundation License (exam cost: £27.50)
 - Allowed up to 10 watts of radio output
 - May not build own equipment
 - May build equipment from approved kits

### Intermediate License (exam cost: £32.50)
 - Allowed up to 50 watts of output
 - May build own equipment

### Advanced License (exam cost: £37.50)
 - Allowed up to 400 watts of output
 - May apply to use other bands

## Ofcom

Radio licencing is controller by Ofcom in the UK. They are who you need to apply
to in order to keep your radio licence up-to-date, and who will provide your
call sign.

If you are going to get your radio licence, you need to create an account and
choose a call sign (for foundation you will have something like M0XYZ where you
can choose the XYZ, if it is free.

Once you have chosen this, you need to attach proof of your examination, when
approved you will be free to use your new call sign in the ways allowed!

## Resources

We have books for the foundation licensing in the TinkerSoc supplies cupboard,
if you would like to borrow it for exam revision, just send us an email and
we'll lend it to you. Alternatively you can buy it online from Amazon for about
£5.
