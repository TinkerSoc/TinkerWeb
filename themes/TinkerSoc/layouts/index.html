    <p>It’s a Wednesday night and you have decided that you want to MAKE
    something. But, where on campus do you go if you want to do some sewing?
    Perhaps you have an itch to turn something on a lathe or want just want to
    send a radio wave around the world?

    <p>TinkerSoc, Kent’s Maker society, is the place to go. Whether it’s 3D
    printing something, or cutting through materials with lasers, we have the
    tools and experience to help you with your project. We even run workshops,
    so that you can pick up new skills (no experience is required!)

    <p>So, if this has piqued your interest and you want to hang out with
    like-minded people who enjoy making things, then pop along to The Shed (the
    School of Computing’s Makerspace - located in the Cornwallis Quad) from 7PM
    on a Wednesday night!

    <p>Your first time at TinkerSoc is always free and subs go towards hosting
    workshops and funding new tools.
